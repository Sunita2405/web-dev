# Box-Model in CSS:-
-Using box model we can specify how an element should be displayed on the web page by giving properties - height & width, padding, border, and margin.
-The innermost layer of the box model is content itself which includes height and width. Following by padding, border and margin respectively.

## Padding:- It is the inner space between the content and border.
-Padding values will be applied on the four sides of the content when single value is given for padding.

POSITION PROPERTY-
-It is used as a special method in css to specify the exact structure and position of each element.

-These elements are not affected by top right left bottom properties.

2.Relative-
-The element is positioned relative to its originalposition getting the top left right bottom value will move that element from its originalposition and other elements will not be affected by absolute.

3.Absolute-
-It positioned an element relative to its parent relative container if there is not parent container with position relative then it relative to the body and these elements an overlap other elements.
4.Fixed-
-The element will be fixed permanently at specific position relative to body.

5.Sticky-
-The element will behave as normal element and gets fixed once its reaches certain point of the webpage,
-A sticky element toggles between relativeand fixed depending on the position value.
